To implement a system where users create a simple markdown file as a **Table of Contents (ToC)** in the markdown platform, and then use that ToC to dynamically build the **Quarto static website**, we can make a few modifications to the current workflow:

### Overview of the Workflow

1. **User creates a ToC markdown file** on the markdown platform.
2. **FastAPI backend** provides the ToC markdown file along with the rest of the content.
3. **Python script** (`fetch_content.py`) fetches the ToC and individual markdown files from the FastAPI API.
4. The **Quarto project** uses the fetched ToC to build the website’s structure dynamically, using links to the individual markdown files.

### Steps to Implement

#### 1. Modify the API to Serve a Table of Contents

Ensure the FastAPI backend has a specific markdown file designated as the **Table of Contents**. This file could look something like this:

#### Example ToC Markdown (`table_of_contents.md`)
```markdown
---
id: "table_of_contents"
title: "Documentation Table of Contents"
tags: ["toc", "index"]
version: 1
created_at: "2024-09-01"
updated_at: "2024-09-02"
---

# Documentation Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](intro)
2. [Guide to FastAPI](fastapi_guide)
3. [API Endpoints](api_endpoints)
4. [Advanced Topics](advanced_topics)
```

The links (e.g., `[Introduction](intro)`) correspond to the markdown files’ `id` fields. These will be replaced by links to the generated `.qmd` files.

#### 2. Fetch the ToC and Markdown Content

The `fetch_content.py` script can be updated to fetch both the ToC file and the markdown content, saving everything into the appropriate Quarto project structure.

#### Updated `fetch_content.py`

```python
import requests
import os

# Set the API URL and output directory
API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/markdowns/"
OUTPUT_DIR = "content/generated"

# Ensure the output directory exists
os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

# Fetch the list of markdown files from the API
response = requests.get(API_URL)
markdown_files = response.json()

# Fetch and process the Table of Contents (ToC)
toc_file = None
for md_file in markdown_files:
    if "toc" in md_file["tags"]:  # Find the ToC file based on tags
        toc_file = md_file
        break

if not toc_file:
    raise ValueError("No Table of Contents file found in the API response.")

# Save the Table of Contents as index.qmd
toc_content = toc_file["content"]
toc_content = toc_content.replace('(', '(generated/')  # Adjust links to point to the generated files
with open("index.qmd", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"# {toc_file['title']}\n\n")
    f.write(toc_content)

# Process and save each markdown file
for md_file in markdown_files:
    if "toc" not in md_file["tags"]:  # Skip the ToC file
        file_id = md_file["id"]
        file_content = md_file["content"]
        
        # Write each markdown content to a .qmd file in the generated directory
        output_path = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, f"{file_id}.qmd")
        with open(output_path, "w") as f:
            f.write(f"# {md_file['title']}\n\n")
            f.write(file_content)

print("Markdown files fetched and written to 'content/generated/' directory.")
```

### 3. Modify Quarto Configuration to Use the ToC

Update the `_quarto.yml` file to ensure the site is structured correctly and references the Table of Contents as the home page.

#### `_quarto.yml`
```yaml
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: _site

website:
  title: "Markdown Service Documentation"
  description: "A static website generated from markdown files served by a FastAPI backend."
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: Home
        href: index.qmd
      - text: Documentation
        href: generated

format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-title: "Table of Contents"
```

### 4. Running the Workflow

Now that the setup is complete:

1. **Start the FastAPI backend** and ensure it serves both the ToC and individual markdown files.
   
2. **Run the Python script** to fetch the content:
   ```bash
   python fetch_content.py
   ```

   This script will:
   - Fetch the ToC markdown.
   - Modify the links in the ToC to point to the generated `.qmd` files.
   - Save the ToC as `index.qmd` and the individual markdown files in `content/generated/`.

3. **Build the Quarto website**:
   ```bash
   quarto render
   ```

   This will create the `_site` directory containing the rendered HTML pages.

4. **Preview the site**:
   ```bash
   quarto preview
   ```

   The website will be available at `http://localhost:4000`, and the **Table of Contents** will act as the homepage, dynamically linking to the other markdown files.

### Example Output

The homepage (`index.qmd`):

```markdown
# Documentation Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](generated/intro.qmd)
2. [Guide to FastAPI](generated/fastapi_guide.qmd)
3. [API Endpoints](generated/api_endpoints.qmd)
4. [Advanced Topics](generated/advanced_topics.qmd)
```

Each of the other `.qmd` files will contain the raw markdown content fetched from the API, rendered into HTML by Quarto.

### Summary

- **Table of Contents** is created by the user on the markdown platform.
- The **Python script** fetches the ToC and all markdown files from the API, generating corresponding `.qmd` files.
- The **Quarto site** uses the ToC as the main entry point, dynamically building the website based on user-defined links.

This system provides flexibility to manage the structure of the static site through the user-generated Table of Contents, allowing content to be easily updated or reordered without hardcoding the site structure in Quarto itself.

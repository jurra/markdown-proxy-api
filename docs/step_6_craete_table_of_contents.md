# Table of Contents
A table of content can be created in another markdown file.
This markdown file can have an id if we use a system like HedgeDoc or Codimd and even be used to fetch the curated list of documents. 
With such a table of content we could also automatically generate a table of contents in systems like quarto or jupyter books for exampple.

Example:
1. [Introduction](introduction.md) --> points to the location of the document (could be a path or a hash in hedgedocs)
2. [Getting Started](getting-started.md)
3. [API Documentation](api-documentation.md)
4. [FAQ](faq.md)
